Now it is the capital of Kaunas County, the seat of the Kaunas city municipality and the Kaunas district municipality. It is also the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kaunas.

Instead of superficial aggregation of information about the country and its tourist attractions, the author tries to delve deeper into describing the country and its people, particularly those aspects about Lithuania and Lithuanians that strike him as different, unique and interesting. The author does provide descriptions about places to go, sites to see, and where to eat, but only selectively based on his own and local Lithuanians\u2019 recommendations. The book also provides a great deal of advice about traveling in Lithuania in order to help you make the most of your visit. The guide is divided into four main parts. Part I gives an overview of Lithuania and its people. Part II describes recommended places to visit, dine and recreate. Part III provides practical advice about a wide range of logistical matters. Finally, Part IV presents a concise history of Lithuania. 50% of the author's net proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated to a Lithuanian charity, Maisto Bankas, which provides food to Lithuanian families in need.","title":"Experiencing Lithuania: An Unconventional Travel Guide","url":"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Experiencing-Lithuania-Unconventional-Travel-Guide\/dp\/1475042221%3FSubscriptionId%3D1ERC8D3Q83S91BW8KGR2%26tag%3Dreezom-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3D1475042221"},{"thumbnail":"http:\/\/ecx.images-amazon.com\/images\/I\/41gU7y9qSHL._SL160_.jpg","review":"<DIV><P class=MsoBodyText3 style=\"MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt\">This vibrant series covers over 150 destinations worldwide, from cosmopolitan urban delights to sun-kissed beach idylls.
